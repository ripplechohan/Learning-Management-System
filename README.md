## Database creation

This project uses the MySQL as database.

Inside the folder **sql_structure** there is a SQL script file that is responsible for creating the LMS database, as well as all the tables for our project.

This script also creates a new user "lms_system", so all of our backend can use the same user for connection (the password is inside the file).
